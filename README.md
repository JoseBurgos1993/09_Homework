# 09_Homework
For this assignment, I was tasked to create a README generator. I used Inquirer and many Awaits to prompt the user for various pieces of information in order to generate a newREADME.md file. This README was created by using this application. Except for the License part. The github repository is https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/09_Homework. Here is a video demonstrating the application https://drive.google.com/file/d/122HSzc2diuBOVoP09RgWRimd5jNP5Xf5/view?usp=sharing.

## Installation
Install inquirer and fs inside the ./Develop directory. You can then run the application with: node index.js

## Usage
The application will prompt the user multiple times. Type out exactly what you want for each section. When it gets to contributors and sources, you must declare how many of each you want. Minimum 1 for contributors and minimum 0 for sources. Once all prompts are answered, the newREADME.md file is created.
